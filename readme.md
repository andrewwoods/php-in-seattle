# PHP In Seattle

There are a lot of companies in Seattle, and it is hard to keep track. If you 
know of any PHP-based companies with offices in the Seattle area, add them here. 

**For Employers:**

* PHP should be a significant part of their software stack  
* Need to have a presence in the Seattle Area
* Try to limit to companies within 20 miles

[Companies](companies.md) 

**What about Recruiters?**

They're helpful for people who are looking for PHP-related jobs. So to make
things easy, we added a markdown file for recruiters and staffing companies.

* Use the recruiters.md file
* Need to have a presence in Seattle Area
* Try to limit to companies within 20 miles.

The focus is on recruiters with Seattle-area offices, because we want them to
be part of our community. In part, the hope is they will attend a meetup to
tell us about PHP-related positions.
