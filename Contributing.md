When adding a company, sort them by name and use this format:

**Company Name**

```
1 Main St
Unit 1
Seattle, WA 98101
```

| [@username](https://twitter.com/username)

PHP Tech: e.g. WordPress, Laravel, etc.

The collection of companies is organized alphabetically. Names that begin with a
number e.g. 99 Designs, should be organized under **Numbers**.
